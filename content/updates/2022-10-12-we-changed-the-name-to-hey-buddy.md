I guess it's kind of obvious if you're reading this on the new site, but I needed to post an update to make sure this would display properly.

## R﻿e-brand

T﻿il recently, we've called ourselves "Dudes Funny" and focused the podcast on making a movie. Now we're calling ourselves "Hey Buddy" with a much wider range of topics.

### T﻿heme of the podcast

N﻿ow the idea of the podcast is two buddies that haven't hung out for years. Like a lot of millineals, we're reconnecting to fill each other in on the gap between highschool and adulthood.

W﻿e review movies, share recommendations, and talk about cool, paranormal stuff.

Join us as we catch up on life, movies, spirituality, and movies.
